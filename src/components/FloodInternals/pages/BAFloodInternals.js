            <p className="mb-1">
                Broker will only honor cancellation requests made in writing and signed by the Client. Broker may provide client with insurance identification 
                cards upon completion of the application process. Client acknowledges and understands that insurance coverage is not provided until the 
                application is underwritten and accepted by the insurance company. Accordingly, the identification cards cannot be used as proof of insurance by 
                the Client until the insurance company has bound and issued coverage as evidenced by a declaration page and/or policy. Client understands that 
                a “binder” number is not evidence of insurance until the declaration page is issued. Broker and Client agree to binding arbitration with ADR of 
                any disputes in which the amount claimed exceeds the Small Claims Court jurisdiction under the rules set up by the ADR, in accordance with 
                California Code of Civil Procedure, without right of appeal.
